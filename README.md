Project 2 â€“ CNN & Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification
Your second project for this course involves building a deep learning pipeline to classify medical
images, drawing from real-world data and deploying robust models. The task will assess your
ability to preprocess data, implement and compare multiple models (including transfer learning),
and interpret model performance.
